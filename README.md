# Hi, I'm Andrian 👋

I'm a game developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦, currently based in Italy 🇮🇹. 

I've been working in the game industry for the past 3 years, mainly focusing on **C++** and **Unreal Engine 5**. 

Lately, I’ve been spending my free time diving into low-level graphics with **OpenGL** and **Vulkan**. As a learning project, I'm also building my own game engine — I know it’s a classic path, but it’s been the best way for me to understand how things work under the hood.

Feel free to check out my repositories or reach out if you'd like to chat about gamedev!
